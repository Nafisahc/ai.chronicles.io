            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of machines and software that can perform tasks
                that traditionally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience (data),
                recognizing patterns, making decisions, understanding language, and even perceiving the world through
                vision or speech. AI mimics cognitive functions, making it a powerful tool in various fields such as
                healthcare, finance, and entertainment.</p>

                    vehicles. While Narrow AI can outperform humans in certain tasks, it operates within a constrained

        Key Concepts In AI</h2>
    <div class="concept">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Machine Learning (ML)</h4>
                Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows computers to learn from data and improve their
                performance without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed instructions, ML algorithms
                identify patterns and use them to make predictions or decisions. ML can be divided into three types:
            </li><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Supervised Learning : </b> In this approach, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that
                    the input data comes with known outputs. The model learns to predict the correct output based on the
                    input examples. A common example is spam email detection, where the algorithm learns from labeled
                    "spam" and "not spam" emails.</li>
                <li><b> Unsupervised Learning : </b> Here, the model is given data without explicit labels, and it must
                    find patterns or structures within the data on its own. Clustering (grouping similar items together)
                    and anomaly detection are common tasks in unsupervised learning. An example could be customer
                    segmentation in marketing.</li>
                <li> <b>Reinforcement Learning : </b> In reinforcement learning, an agent learns by interacting with an
                    environment, taking actions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time,
                    the agent improves its performance by maximizing the cumulative reward. This type of learning is
                    commonly used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous driving.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <li>
                <h4> Deep Learning </h4>
                Deep Learning is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that focuses on neural networks with many
                layers, often referred to as deep neural networks. These networks can learn from large amounts of data
                and automatically extract features, making them ideal for complex tasks like image and speech
                recognition. Deep Learning is behind breakthroughs like self-driving cars, facial recognition software,
                and voice assistants. The technology relies on large datasets and high computational power, and it's
                capable of improving its performance with more data over time.
            </li> <br>

            <li>
                <h4>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h4> Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to
                understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP bridges the gap between human communication and
                computer understanding. It includes tasks such as speech recognition, language translation, sentiment
                analysis, and chatbot interactions. NLP is widely used in virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa),
                translation apps, and customer service automation. The challenge with NLP lies in understanding the
                nuances of language, such as context, idioms, and slang, which require sophisticated algorithms and
                large datasets.
            </li><br>

            <li>
                <h4>Computer Vision </h4>Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information
                from the world, much like humans do. It allows AI systems to process and analyze images and videos to
                extract useful insights. Applications of computer vision include facial recognition, object detection,
                and medical image analysis. For example, AI-powered systems in healthcare can analyze X-rays and MRIs to
                detect diseases like cancer. The field has made significant progress thanks to deep learning techniques,
                but challenges remain in handling variations in lighting, angles, and visual obstructions.

                <h4>Step 2: Data Preprocessing</h4>
                <p>Before feeding data into an AI model, it needs to be cleaned and prepared. This involves removing any
                    inconsistencies, handling missing values, and normalizing the data. Data preprocessing ensures that
                    the model can learn effectively and is critical to the success of any AI project. For example, in
                    text analysis, it might involve removing stopwords and stemming words to ensure the model can focus
                    on the most important parts of the data.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Model Building</h4>
                <p>In this step, a machine learning algorithm or neural network model is selected. Depending on the
                    task, different types of models are used—decision trees, support vector machines, or deep neural
                    networks. The model is then "trained" using the preprocessed data, allowing it to learn patterns and
                    relationships within the dataset.</p>

            <div class="step-box text-center">
                <h4>Step 4: Training</h4>
                <p>During training, the model is exposed to the data and iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize
                    errors in its predictions or decisions. Training involves running data through the model repeatedly
                    and updating the model's internal parameters (such as weights in neural networks) until it can
                    accurately predict outcomes. The effectiveness of the training process is often evaluated using a
                    separate set of data known as the validation set.</p>

                <h4>Step 5: Testing and Evaluation</h4>
                <p>Once the model has been trained, it's time to test its performance on new, unseen data. The goal is
                    to assess how well the model generalizes to new examples. Evaluation metrics depend on the task at
                    hand—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used for classification tasks, while
                    mean squared error (MSE) is often used for regression problems.</p>

                <h4>Step 6: Deployment</h4>
                <p>After testing and fine-tuning, the AI system is ready for deployment. This involves integrating the
                    trained model into a real-world application, such as a chatbot in a customer service system or a
                    recommendation engine on an e-commerce site. Deployment also involves continuous monitoring to
                    ensure the system works as expected and to make adjustments if the data or environment changes over
                    time.</p>
